# Hands-On: Python Conditional Statements - Solutions

These exercises focus on using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control program flow. You'll work with comparison operators, logical operators, and data types from Lesson 1 to make decisions in your code.

---

## Hands-On #1:

---

### Exercise 1: Check if a Number is Positive

**Goal**: Write a Python Script that asks a user for an integer number, and then checks if the number is positive using an `if` statement.

```python
number = int(input("What number would you like to check?  "))

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive")
```

✅ *Check*: Should print "The number is positive" if the number is greater than 0.

---

### Exercise 2: Even or Odd

**Goal**: Write a Python script that asks a user for an integer number.  Check if the number is even or odd using `if` and `else`.

```python
number = int(input("Enter an integer:  "))

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")
```

✅ *Check*: Should print "Even" or "Odd" based on the number.

---

### Exercise 3: Age Category

**Goal**: Write a python script that asks a user for their age, and then uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` to print the correct category for the person by based on their age.

```python
age = int(input("How old are you?  "))

if age < 13:
    print("Child")
elif age <= 19:
    print("Teenager")
elif age <= 64:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Senior")
```

✅ *Check*: Should print the correct category based on age.

---

### Exercise 4: Compare Two Numbers

**Goal**: Write a Python Script that asks a user for two numbers.  Compare the two numbers and print which is larger, or if they're equal.

```python
first_number = float(input("What is the first number?  "))
second_number = float(input("What is the second number?  "))

if first_number > second_number:
    print(first_number, "is larger")
elif b > a:
    print(second_number, "is larger")
else:
    print("The numbers are equal")
```

✅ *Check*: Should print "a is larger", "b is larger", or "a and b are equal".

---

### Exercise 5: Grade Converter

**Goal**: Write a Python Script that asks a user for a numeric grade, and then converts a numeric grade to a letter grade and prints the letter grade.


```python
score = int(input("Enter a grade:  "))

if score >= 90:
    print("A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("C")
elif score >= 60:
    print("D")
else:
    print("F")
```

✅ *Check*: Should print the correct letter grade.

---

### Exercise 6: String Length Check

**Goal**: Write a Python Script that asks the user for an input string.  Then check if a string has more than 10 characters.  Print "Long string" if it is longer than 10 characters, print "Short string" if it is shorter.

```python
text = input("Enter your input string:  ")

if len(text) > 10:
    print("Long string")
else:
    print("Short string")
```

✅ *Check*: Should print "Long string" if length > 10, else "Short string".

---

### Exercise 7: Logical AND Operator

**Goal**: Write a Python script that asks the user for a number.  Check if a number is between 10 and 20 (inclusive) using the `and` operator.  Print "Number is in range" if it is in between 10 and 20.  Otherwise it should print "Out of range."

```python
number = float(input("Enter a number:  "))

if number >= 10 and number <= 20:
    print("Number is in range")
else:
    print("Out of range")
```

✅ *Check*: Should print "Number is in range" if between 10 and 20, else "Out of range".

---

### Exercise 8: Logical OR Operator

**Goal**: Write a python script that checks if a character is a vowel using the `or` operator.  Print "vowel" or "consonant" depending on the input.

```python
letter = input("Enter a letter:  ")

if letter == "a" or letter == "e" or letter == "i" or letter == "o" or letter == "u":
    print("Vowel")
else:
    print("Consonant")

# Alternative solution using 'in'
if letter in "aeiou":
    print("Vowel")
else:
    print("Consonant")
```

✅ *Check*: Should print "Vowel" if the letter is a, e, i, o, or u, else "Consonant".

elif bmi < 25:
    print("BMI:",bmi," - Normal weight")
elif bmi < 30:
